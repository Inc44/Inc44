#### My "passion" is surviving an 80-hour week from Monday to Saturday.
But hey, I still have time for my projects!

- **MaTools** — for when you need to “organize” files (hide them).
- **CoFlu** — to fix typos, because apparently, grammar is a social construct.
- **And Rust?** That’s my “spinning donut of doom,” faster than your WiFi.

#### Contributions?
On my way to **1500**. Basically a part-time job.
But hey, it’s not about making a difference—it’s about the *illusion* of productivity.

#### My stars?
Proof I’m not alone in this madness.
